0: Infomation Page

1: Pythagorean Theorem: A^2 + B^2 = C^2
	Enter in all varibles. Enter 0 for the varible you wish to solve
	Arg 2: The Leter of the varible you wish to solve. EXP: A or a
	Arg 3: Lenght of side: A
	Arg 4: Lenght of side: B
	Arg 5: Length of side: C

2: Area's of shapes:
	Arg 2: The number of the shape you wish to solve:
	    1: Rectangle: A = L * W
	       Arg 3: Lenght
	       Arg 4: Width
	    2: Triangle: A = (H * B) / 2
	       Arg 3: Height
	       Arg 4: Base
	    3: Circle: A = (pi) * r^2 
	       Arg 3: Radius
	    4: Cylinder: A = (2*(pi)*R*H) + (2*(pi)*R^2)
	       Arg 3: Radius
 	       Arg 4: Height

3: Quadratic Formula: x = (-b +or- sqrt(b^2 - 4*A*C) / 2*A
